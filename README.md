# airline_delays_bigdata
Classification problem; find the optimal model to classify whether we will have departure delay, by using PySpark.

This project presents a machine learning approach implemented in PySpark to classify whether a flight had delay on departure based on data related with the flight. The objective of this study is to develop an intuitive understanding about the dataset, generate insightful visualizations, and implement a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a flight had a delayed departure. Data processing techniques including data cleaning, encoding and data exploratory analysis were applied to produce processed data sets. A variety of supervised machine learning algorithms were applied to the data including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees as well as Naïve Bayes. Our best performing algorithm (Naïve Bayes) allows us to correctly predict the status of approximately 67% of the flights. The findings of this study can provide valuable insights for airlines to improve their services and enhance passenger satisfaction.
