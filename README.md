# Airline Delays Prediction Using PySpark

## Project Overview
This project employs a machine learning approach using PySpark to classify flight departure delays. It aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, create insightful visualizations, and implement predictive models to accurately classify flight delays.

### Research Objectives
- Develop an intuitive understanding of the flight dataset.
- Generate visualizations to uncover patterns in flight delays.
- Implement and evaluate various supervised machine learning algorithms to predict departure delays.

## Dataset
Data sourced from [Kaggle's Airline Delay and Cancellation Data, 2009 - 2018 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018)

## Methodology
- **Data Processing**: Includes data cleaning, encoding, and exploratory analysis to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Development**: Utilizing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Naïve Bayes algorithms.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with a focus on accurately predicting flight delays.

## Results
Naïve Bayes emerged as the best performing algorithm, accurately predicting the departure status of approximately 67% of flights. The insights gained from this study are valuable for airlines to enhance service quality and passenger satisfaction.

## Limitations and Future Work
Future research should explore more advanced models and techniques to further improve prediction accuracy and understand the factors influencing flight delays.

## Tools and Technologies
